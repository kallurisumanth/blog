STEPS
Cut card stock into 5-inch squares. Fold a square in half, then fold in half again. Open square, and crease diagonally, reversing direction of fold; repeat to make another diagonal crease.

Fold square back up along original creases. Trace petal template onto square.

Cut out along open edges. Snip off a tiny bit of pointed tip; unfold flower.

With an unused pencil eraser and green ink, stamp small marks at indents on each petal.

Use a starburst-style stamp to mark center. Cut out leaves from green card stock. Secure flowers and leaves to branches with clear craft glue.
