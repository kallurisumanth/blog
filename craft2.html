<h1>STEPS:</h1>

<ol type="i">
<li><p>Cover work area with newspapers or plastic. Lay down aluminum foil to serve as a drying station.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix 2 parts plaster of Paris powder to 1 part water. Because it dries very quickly—you can work with it for about 15 minutes before it becomes too dry—you should mix small batches, one at a time. Sprinkle powder into water, covering surface evenly. (Don't pour powder in just one spot or it may clump.) Gently mix until plaster is smooth and uniform, with a consistency like that of pancake batter. Let stand 1 minute.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut individual leaves off faux floral spray to dip. Wrap a length of wire around object, or poke it into base. Dip object in plaster mixture, gently swirl to coat, then remove and let excess drip off; hang object by wire from hanger and let dry completely, about 24 hours. Depending on object's shape, you may also hold it in your hand to dip it (the stem of a leaf, for example). Lay object directly on foil to dry, keeping in mind that places where plaster touches foil won't be completely covered and will show pooling at edges. For that reason, place areas that won't be seen in your finished project, such as the bottom of leaves, on foil. For a more opaque finish, let items dry completely, then dip again.</p></li>
<li><p>Twist them into clusters with floral wire and secured them to a premade bay garland dotted with ivory velvet bows.</p></li>
